# pygame_roguelike
Action roguelike in python with pygame engine.


# PLANING

## Next to implement
- more env objects (like trees)


## Soon 
- Enemies keep distance to each other
- player Items
- pysics, knock-back
- enemy projectiles 
- better main menu 
- Leaderboard 
- fixed map size
- Multiplayer
- Enemies get different velocities on axis (snake is get better vertical speed)

# Bugs

- projectiles move with the player
- No third try when playing (Respawn player Bug)


## Done (but still not perfect)
- better movement AI
- Monsters do not spawn off-screen - FIXED 
- Collision with player is buggy - FIXED
- Debug view, coordinates over object and more info


# DEV Log
### 9.1.23
Failed to implement that enemies keep distance to each other, not sure how to make them spreed to avoid stacking  

# Thanks for the inspiration
