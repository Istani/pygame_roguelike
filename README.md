# Bugs

## Done (but still not perfect)
- better movement AI

- Collision with player is buggy - FIXED
- Debug view, coordinates over object and more info
- more env objects (like trees)


# DEV Log
### 9.1.23
Failed to implement that enemies keep distance to each other, not sure how to make them spreed to avoid stacking  
### 10.1.23
Added a class to read tilesheets and select random sprites for grass and add some more objects. Feels like progress. :)


# Thanks for the inspiration
