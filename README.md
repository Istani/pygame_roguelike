# pygame_roguelike
Action roguelike in python with pygame engine.


# PLANING

## Next to implement
- Enemies keep distance to each other 


## Soon 
- more env objects (like trees)
- player Items
- pysics, knock-back
- enemy projectiles 
- better main menu 
- Leaderboard 
- fixed map size
- Multiplayer

## Bugs to fix 
- Monsters do not spawn off-screen - FIXED 
- projectiles move with the player
- No third try when playing (Respawn player Bug)

## Done (but still not perfect)
- better movement AI
