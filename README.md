# pygame_roguelike
Action roguelike in python with pygame engine.


# PLANING

## Next to implement
- fixed map size


## Soon 
- Enemies keep distance to each other
- player Items
- Health bars
- better main menu 
- Leaderboard 
- Better peng sound

- class to manage font styles 
- Enemies get different velocities on axis (snake is get better vertical speed)

## Maybe later
- Build system
- Multiplayer

# Bugs
- Sometimes enemy tremble because the change direction on each frame.
- player projectiles move with the player.
- No third try when playing (Respawn player Bug).


## Done (but still not perfect)
- better movement AI
- Monsters do not spawn off-screen - FIXED 
- Collision with player is buggy - FIXED
- Debug view, coordinates over object and more info
- more env objects (like trees)
- pysics, knock-back
- enemy projectiles
