# DEV Log

### 9.1.23

Failed to implement that enemies keep distance to each other, not sure how to make them spreed to avoid stacking

### 10.1.23

Added a class to read tilesheets and select random sprites for grass and add some more objects. Feels like progress. :)

### 11.1.23

Knock-back und Enemy live was added to the game. Funny feature

### 12.1.23

Added enemy projectiles to the game. Challenge improved.
It is sometimes hard to see stuff because of the random selected assets, that needs to change soon.
Tomorrow I will improve the map generation.
I think atm the player has to click too much. Maybe add a better projectile or auto shoot.

### 13.1.23

To tired to rework the map. But add health bars on the first try.

### 16.1.23

After a small motivational low I could get myself to try the map rework.
At first, I had no idea how to proceed, but by trying around and following my intuition, it was actually done quickly.
The game now looks a good deal better.

### 19.1.23

I was able to implement the automatic firing of the player's guns. But I couldn't get it to fire automatically to the
next opponent. The problem is the scroll of the screen shifts the coordinates and it is not so easy to adjust a distance
function. It should be reworked as soon as possible how the coordinates of enemies and the player are determined.
preferably all on a single map. How to then move the camera I have to think about.
